# Search Workbench
Collection View is a project that you to visualize your Library of Congress searches so that you can get a better sense of what they are doing.

Search results are visualized as stacked charts, Venn diagrams and proportional bar graphs. Importantly, completed searches can also be directly *compared* with one another as an aide to fine-tuning a search strategy.

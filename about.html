		<h2>Why Collection View?</h2>
    <p>Collection View is in part an extension of my workn <a href="https://esperr.github.io/visualizingpubmed/">
      Visualizing PubMed</a>. Like those projects, Collection View allows you to examine, edit and visualize your searches so that you can get a better sense of what they are doing.
      Importantly, you can also directly <em>compare</em> searches to one another &mdash;
      facilitating the process of fine-tuning a search strategy.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>

    <p>When you enter a search, it is run against PubMed using the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/">programmatic interface</a> maintained by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>. You first see how your search
      is translated by <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmedtutorial/020_040.html">Automated Term Mapping</a>. Then you see how the parts of your search relate to one another (using the logic that drives <a href="https://pubvenn.appspot.com/">PubVenn</a>) and how that search performs over time
      (via <a href="https://esperr.github.io/pubmed-by-year/">PubMed-by-year</a>).</p>

    <h3 id="editing">Editing a search</h3>
    <p>Once your search is complete, you can choose to edit it by hand. You can add or subtract terms, Boolean operators and parentheses as well as apply one of several pre-defined search hedges.
    <em>Note:</em> there is no validation of this edited search before you run it, so beware of typos, unmatched parentheses and field tags that don't fit.</p>

    <h3 id="nicknames">Search nicknames</h3>
    <p>If you directly edit a PubMed <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmedtutorial/020_040.html">translation</a>, you'll notice that even simple searches, such as "diabetes and heart disease", quickly turn into something a bit more ungainly:</p>
      <blockquote style="font-size: 90%;">
        ("diabetes mellitus"[MeSH Terms] OR ("diabetes"[All Fields] AND "mellitus"[All Fields]) OR "diabetes mellitus"[All Fields] OR "diabetes"[All Fields] OR "diabetes insipidus"[MeSH Terms] OR ("diabetes"[All Fields] AND "insipidus"[All Fields]) OR "diabetes insipidus"[All Fields]) AND ("heart diseases"[MeSH Terms] OR ("heart"[All Fields] AND "diseases"[All Fields]) OR "heart diseases"[All Fields] OR ("heart"[All Fields] AND "disease"[All Fields]) OR "heart disease"[All Fields])
      </blockquote>
      <img src="nickname.PNG" alt="screenshot snippet" />
      <p>Using such long strings as search labels makes it difficult to see slight variations in a search. It also makes comparing them on a chart cumbersome.</p>
      <p>In these cases, please take advantage of the ability to <em>nickname</em> a search. Choose a name, click "add", and you'll use that nickname for that search going forward
      </p>



    <h3 id="managing">Managing and comparing searches</h3>
    <img src="comp1.PNG" alt="screenshot snippet" />

    <p>Once you have two or more searches, you can easily compare them using the tools found underneath "Searches".</p>

    <p>Choose the searches you want to compare from a list of ones already performed and select "Compare searches" &mdash; you will then see that comparison diagrammed using the same chart-by-year and Venn diagrams seen at the outset.
    <em>Note:</em> you can choose as many searches to compare as are needed, though the diagrams can get more cluttered.</p>
    <img src="comp2.PNG" alt="screenshot snippet" />

    <p>Importantly, you can easily review (or nickname, or delete) any past search by choosing it from the list. Choosing </p>
    <br style="clear: both;"/>
    <h3 id="saving">Saving or retrieving a session</h3>
    <p>If you want to save a session for later, you have the option of saving it locally or to a text file. Local sessions are more convenient to work with, but they are <em>only</em> accessible on the browser/machine where you created them. Text files can be used on any machine (and by any user) that can read them.</p>
    <p>You will note the "Load previous session" buttons when you start a session. Just choose the locally saved session (or text file) you want, and you can resume where you left off.</p>

    <h3 id="uniques">Seeing unique records</h3>
    <p>When you are comparing two or more searches, you can choose "Show unique records" to show those citations that show up in one search, but not in any of the others you are comparing at that moment.</p>

  	<h3>Technologies</h3>
		<p>PubMed by Year is put together with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Search translations and counts are fetched with NCBI's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/">
      Entrez Programming Utilities</a>. NCBI does not yet have an easy way to grab by-year counts for a search (short of launching 50+ calls to the API), so a <a href="https://github.com/esperr/med-by-year">custom webservice</a>
      is used.</p>
      <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart">Google Charts</a> is used to draw the line charts, and Ben Fredrickson's <a href="https://github.com/benfred/venn.js/tree/master">venn.js</a> overlay of Mike Bostock's <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>
      performs the set visualization. Responsive layout is made easier with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
